Would there be a way to have the margins of the maze change
if the aspect ratio of each cell does not fall within some
set boundary? Or have them always be squares?
aspect ratio thing is good because if they were always squares,
could end up with some weird spacing, but people like squares
this would not be that much of a problem to add - just
would have to revamp logic in drawMaze - would be cool!
