Would there be a way to have the margins of the maze change
if the aspect ratio of each cell does not fall within some
set boundary? Or have them always be squares?
aspect ratio thing is good because if they were always squares,
could end up with some weird spacing, but people like squares
this would not be that much of a problem to add - just
would have to revamp logic in drawMaze - would be cool!
- find max(dims[0], dims[1]) and have the margins be based on which is
the greatest; then determine the dimensions of the cell based on that,
and put other margins based on that


boundary updating when rows and cols are updated by user


when clicking and dragging to make boundaries in solve mode,
have default setting be adding or removing based on which
square the user started in - as it is now, it's always adding
when dragging

more on dragging: have a way to circumvent the extra
vertical lines a user might get when they try to
click and drag to create a long horizontal boundary





TO PREVENT LAGGING:

have different boundary list for left bounds and right bounds? Might
help with lagging? Or try some different data structure instead of set?
- make sure to change what the boundary thing is initialized to
- when the Clear Maze button is pressed

- change redrawDelay based on the size of the boundaries set?
for lagging purposes


ONLY DRAW what needs to be drawn, like just the boundaries
only pass in the parts of mazeData to the hover, click, & drag functions
that you absolutely need




Changes made:
- instead of calling drawMaze in mouseClicked, called drawBoundaries
- made sure all entries in boundaries are ints
